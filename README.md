# Fotoshoppe

A photo equipment rental application that is created using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, NodeJS).

## Overview

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create an account by signing up and then singning in to the app. The user is also given the option to browse the equipment by page, by category (e.g Camera Body, Lenses, Flashes), or sort the equipment by ascending and descending order. For future development the user will be able to add an item to a wishlist and rent by adding the item/equipment to a cart and checkout.
